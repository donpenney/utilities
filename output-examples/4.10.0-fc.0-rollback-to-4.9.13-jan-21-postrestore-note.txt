The 4.10.0-fc.0 rollback to 4.9.13 has a couple of challenges.

Networking configuration changes (it seems) cause difficulty on the
4.9 side, so a reboot is needed after restoring /etc. This is
determined in the script by checking the list of files to be restored,
and looking for NetworkManager files.

In addition, the machine-config-daemon (MCD) has a problem reconciling
the node, marking it degraded. For some reason, it complains about a
missing rendered-master mc file from the 4.10 side, which does not
exist after the restore. I was unable to find the reference to this mc
file to explain how the MCD would even be aware of it. The "current"
and "desired" configs are correct, referring to the 4.9
rendered-master mc, but the MCD still degrades the node.

In order to get past this missing mc issue and complete the restore, I
had to do the same steps as described in the following:

Essentially, cloning the 4.9 rendered-master mc and updating its id to
that of the "missing" mc. Once this is done, the MCD is able to finish
reconciliation and the node is happy.
